# A simple webpage for **Assignment 1 - Task 5**

### This is a simple Webpage I created to fulfil the requirements of Assignment 1 - Task 5 of the 140.628 Data Science for Public Health Course taught by Prof. B. Caffo  

- This webpage has been created by writing some markdown text in `index.md` file in my repository `Aditya-Dahiya/ds4bmeTest`.

- I am populating this webpage with a demonstration of writing some basic code chunk in R-markdown as shown below:---

```{r chunk1, echo=TRUE}
2+2  

x <- rnorm(100)  

plot(x)  

```
